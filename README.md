# TennisResults

I used some datasets which contained the results of the last years of the ATP Tennis Male games of past years.
Mainly I did some queries to see results depending on nationality and then I started to look for different stats of some players, this was mainly done because I had curiosity on random things, also helps me to practice SQL and I'll try to update it 

Next I'm thinking on doing a Python Notebook to do more analysis on this datasets
